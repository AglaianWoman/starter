### Roadmap

Roadmap is very general and shows a vision and in which direction this project is going.

- user authentication by Facebook, Google or Linkedin with providing credentials in root.json configuration
- import layout from another github repository (in quite similar way as in wordpress)
- count visiting item (showing views)
- internal comments widget
- edit items by community (i.e. improve specific fields like tags) to make database more relevant
- google images widget in admin for faster image searching
- items rating (configurable 1-5, 1-10 or likes / stars). To be decided yet.
- newsletter
